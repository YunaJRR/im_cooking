1. Project Setup

Create a new CodeIgniter project: If you don't have one already, create a new CodeIgniter project using the official installer or by manually setting up the necessary files and folders.
Structure your project: Organize your project's files and folders to match the layout you have. Here's a suggested structure:

project_name/
├── application/
│   ├── controllers/
│   │   ├── Home.php
│   │   ├── About.php
│   │   ├── Contact.php
│   │   └── ... other controllers
│   ├── models/
│   │   ├── User_model.php
│   │   ├── Product_model.php
│   │   └── ... other models
│   ├── views/
│   │   ├── home/
│   │   │   └── index.php
│   │   ├── about/
│   │   │   └── index.php
│   │   ├── contact/
│   │   │   └── index.php
│   │   └── ... other views
│   ├── libraries/
│   ├── helpers/
│   └── config/
├── public/
│   ├── assets/
│   │   └── ... your CSS, JS, images, etc.
│   └── index.php
├── system/
└── ... other CodeIgniter core files

2. Controller Logic

Create controllers: Create a controller for each section of your website. For instance, you might have HomeController, AboutController, ContactController, and so on.
Load views: In each controller method, load the corresponding view using the $this->load->view() method. For example, in HomeController, you might have:

PHP
public function index()
{
    $data['title'] = 'Home Page'; 
    $this->load->view('home/index', $data); 
}
3. View Integration

Create views: Create views for each section of your website within the views folder. Use the CodeIgniter helpers and libraries to generate HTML elements and display data.
4. Model Logic

Create models: If you need to interact with a database, create models to handle database operations. Use the Active Record class provided by CodeIgniter to interact with your database tables.
5. Routing

Configure routes: In application/config/routes.php, define how URLs should map to controllers and methods.
Example:

PHP

$route['default_controller'] = 'Home';
$route['about'] = 'About';
$route['contact'] = 'Contact';
6. Assets

Include assets: In your views, link to your CSS, JavaScript, and image files using the base_url() helper provided by CodeIgniter.
7. Testing and Refinement

Test your website: Thoroughly test your website to ensure everything is working as expected.
Refine and iterate: Continue to refine your code and add new features as needed.
Additional Tips:

Use CodeIgniter helpers: CodeIgniter provides many built-in helpers that can simplify common tasks, such as form validation, URL generation, and date formatting.
Use CodeIgniter libraries: CodeIgniter also provides libraries for more complex tasks, such as email sending, image manipulation, and session management.
Follow CodeIgniter best practices: Adhere to CodeIgniter's coding standards and best practices for a maintainable and scalable application.
By following these steps, you can effectively implement CodeIgniter logic into your website's layout and build a robust and well-structured web application.
